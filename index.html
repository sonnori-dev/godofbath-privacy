              information you permit those services to share, such as your name,

              traffic, improve service quality, and measure advertising
              effectiveness.<br />You may disable cookies in your browser
              settings; however, certain features may not function properly.<br />Third-party
              tools (e.g., Google Analytics) may collect information according

              consent.<br /><br />5. Use of Personal Information<br /><br />Collected

              only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
              this Policy or as required by applicable laws.<br />Once retention
              periods expire or purposes are fulfilled, data is securely deleted
              or anonymized to prevent recovery.<br /><br />7. International
              Data Transfers<br /><br />Your data may be transferred to and
              processed in countries outside your own, including the Republic of
              Korea.<br />In such cases, we take appropriate safeguards to
              ensure your data remains protected in accordance with applicable
              laws (e.g., GDPR Standard Contractual Clauses).<br /><br />8. Data
              Security<br /><br />We implement reasonable technical and
              organizational measures to protect your personal information
              against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
              destruction.<br />However, please note that no method of
              electronic transmission or storage is completely secure.<br /><br />9.
              Children’s Privacy<br /><br />We do not knowingly collect personal
              information from children under the age of 14 (or 13 where
              applicable).<br />If we become aware that we have inadvertently
              collected such information, we will promptly delete it.<br /><br />10.
              Your Rights<br /><br />You have the following rights regarding
              your Personal Information:<br /><br />Access and Correction – You
              have the right to access and correct or update your personal
              information. In many cases, you can do this directly through your
              account settings.<br /><br />Deletion – You have the right to
              request deletion of your personal information. Once verified, we
              will process your request within 30 days, subject to lawful
              extensions. We will retain only minimal records necessary to
              document your request and our response.<br /><br />Restriction –
              You have the right to restrict certain types of processing of your
              personal information.<br /><br />Objection – You have the right to
              object to certain processing activities.<br /><br />Withdrawal of
              Consent – You may withdraw your consent at any time without
              affecting the lawfulness of processing based on prior consent.<br /><br />Complaints
              – You have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection
              authority in your country of residence or employment if you
              believe your data rights have been violated.<br /><br />Requests
              will be handled promptly after verifying your identity, except
              where retention is required by law.<br /><br />11. How to Request
              Data Deletion<br /><br />To request deletion of your personal
              data, please contact us by email with the following details:<br /><br />Your
              account ID or nickname<br /><br />The game or service name<br /><br />The
              email address linked to your account<br /><br />Contact:
              sonnori@sonnori.com<br /><br />Subject line: “Data Deletion
              Request”<br /><br />After verifying your identity, we will delete
              your data except where retention is legally required.<br />Unlinking
              your Meta or platform account alone does not delete in-game data —
              you must send a request as described above.<br /><br />12. Legal
              Basis for Processing (for EU/UK Users)<br /><br />For users in the

              more of the following legal bases:<br /><br />Contract performance
              (to provide and support the Services)<br /><br />Legitimate
              interests (to improve security, functionality, and user
              experience)<br /><br />Legal obligations (to comply with
              applicable laws and regulations)<br /><br />Consent (for optional
              marketing or analytics; may be withdrawn at any time)<br /><br />13.
              Policy Updates<br /><br />We may revise this Policy from time to
              time.<br />Significant changes will be notified via email, in-game
              notice, or other reasonable means.<br />Continued use of the
              Services after such updates constitutes your acceptance of the
              revised Policy.<br /><br />14. Contact Information<br /><br />SONNORI
